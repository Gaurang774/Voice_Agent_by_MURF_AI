The frontend listens to user speech, converts it to text, sends it to the backend, receives an audio reply generated by Murf TTS, and plays it back with a clean chat-style UI. Users can choose voices, speaking styles, speed, and pitch. The backend includes logic generation, TTS processing, and API handling. The system supports real-time conversations and optional short-term memory to maintain context.",
